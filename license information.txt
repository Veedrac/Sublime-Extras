[This is hereby released completely and irrevocably into the Public Domain.]



On many of these codepieces, you will see:

	This is hereby released completely and irrevocably into the Public Domain.


This is a short way of saying:

	This is free and unencumbered software released into the public domain.

	Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use, compile, sell, or
	distribute this software, either in source code form or as a compiled
	binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial, and by any
	means.

	In jurisdictions that recognize copyright laws, the author or authors
	of this software dedicate any and all copyright interest in the
	software to the public domain. We make this dedication for the benefit
	of the public at large and to the detriment of our heirs and
	successors. We intend this dedication to be an overt act of
	relinquishment in perpetuity of all present and future rights to this

Yes, this means you are allowed to plagarise (although you shouldn't). You
can not only sell this software but completely hide the fact it's public
domain.

You are allowed to put this in licenced code and you are allowed to produce
licenced versions (even if identical in all other respects). Those obviously
will not make all other unlicensed versions yours, though.



You may also see versions of:

	My changes are hereby released completely and irrevocably into the
	Public Domain. THE ORIGINAL CODE MAY NOT BE PUBLIC DOMAIN AND THUS
	THIS CODE SHOULD NOT BE THOUGHT OF AS PUBLIC DOMAIN.


This happens when I want to release my changes to public domain but the
original code is licenced. This means that all parts of the code that
directly originate from the licenced code (basically anything they could
claim is at least partly theirs) is still theirs. Everything that's
purely an addition of mine – anything that's completely new – is not
theirs and thus I am able to release to the public domain.

Copyright does not only count by characters. If a line I wrote is a direct
translation of some part of the original code it is still theirs. If I
re-use a technique that is inventive enough for copyright to hold, it is
still their technique. Do not jump to conclusions.



If I have misunderstood anything about licences or public domain, feel free
to contact me.

If you are unhappy about the licencing terms of any of this, especially if
you own some of the utilised code, feel free to raise a complaint. I'll try
and see what I can do.
