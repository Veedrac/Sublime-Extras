Sublime Text Extras
===================

Interjection
------------

*Sublime Text Extras*, also known as *Sublime Extras* or just *Extras* **only** works on **Sublime Text version 3**.


...Back to the good part
-------------------------

A truly awesome set of enhancements to your Sublime Text life!

**Contains many "borrowed" ideas and much "borrowed" code.**


* Create a new cursor at next character, word or the end of the line

* Sane `add_next_line` command â€” don't "lose" cursors in the gutter on empty lines!

* A `find_all_under` that really works with multiple cursors

* Align your cursors across lines

* "Esc" that lets you choose which cursor to escape to

* Inline eval (Python) with format-able auto-numbering and multi-line input and output

* Repeat a macro a specified number of times

* Combine multiple commands in a shortcut with `run_multiple_commands`

* Keep workspace quasi-centered with "spacing borders" on above and below

* Split selections into characters and words

* Split selections *by* lines and remove blank lines from selections

* Keep or dump every nth selection

* Intelligently combine selections

* Store and retrieve selections

* Easily write any named Unicode character using Sublime Text's autocomplete

* + _A tentative hope that this may one day be customizable._

The following are **APNG**s; if you're using Chrome (or Opera) you'll need [an extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apng/ehkepjiconegkhpodgoaeamnpckdbblp), if you're using IE you need to stop it.

![Store, Align, Combine](http://i.imgur.com/UQ71ZET.png)

This first uses storing selections to "jump" the gap, and immediately follows with a store+align+restore+join idiom to extend the cursor. The cursors are then joined and the process starts again.

---

![Selections](http://i.imgur.com/Hk3BLeA.png)

This shows off the improved `add_next_line` handling, the `remove_blank_line_selections` command, the `add_next_character` command and the red shows off choosing where "ESC" lands us.

---

![Eval](http://i.imgur.com/yZduaRH.png)

First you see how full non-trivial expressions can be evaluated and "print" can be used to output text. Then you see that evaluation can work with expressions as well, and on top of that the `$` symbol injects sequential numbers into the code.

---

![Repeat Macro](http://i.imgur.com/L64UVdG.png)

A macro is run... 32 times.

---

![Boundaries](http://i.imgur.com/gRMnDmN.png)

A border of 10 lines is forced above and below.

![Split Selection](http://i.imgur.com/PAEbilM.png)

`run_multiple_commands` is used for the "blocky" selections and the rest is a combination of selection-altering commands.

Some tips on getting set-up
----------------------------

Sublime Extras comes with no shortcuts by default. Additionally the `.sublime-commands` file has yet to be developed.


### Repeat macro

```jquery
{ "keys": [KEYBINDING], "command": "repeat_macro" },
```

Run a macro many times. If you want to use a macro once per selection the normal command is sufficient. If you want to repeat, say, once per line, reduce to the above problem.

Thanks to Sivakumar Kailasam for the basis of this code. In fact there seems to be no true advantage to my code except that it is simpler by removing some of the redundancy that the original had.













### Save and restore selections

```jquery
{
	"keys": [KEYBINDING],
	"command": "store_selections",
	"args": { "preset": "selection storage", "doubleclick": true }
},

{
	"keys": [KEYBINDING],
	"command": "activate_selections",
	"args": { "preset": "selection storage" }
},

{
	"keys": [KEYBINDING],
	"command": "activate_selected_selections",
	"args": { "preset": "selection storage" }
},

{
	"keys": [KEYBINDING],
	"command": "clear_saved_selections",
	"args": { "preset": "selection storage" }
},
```

The "preset" section will eventually be customisable, so don't worry about that. The other customizations will be described when that is done.

`store_selections` saves selections to storage. If "doubleclick" is True, it will activate selections if all current selections are in storage.

`activate_selections` pops selections from storage. It can take a "clear" argument for if you want to change whether to clear the storage, which defaults to True.

`activate_selected_selections` pops selections from storage if they are contained within a currently-active selection. If there are no contained selections and you have up to one cursor of size 0 this will fall back to activate_selections. It can take a "clear" argument for if you want to change whether to clear the storage, defaults to True.

`clear_saved_selections` does what it says on the tin.


### Better escape

```jquery
{
	"keys": ["escape"],
	"command": "choosy_selection_select",
	"args": { "preset": "choosy single selection", "forward": true  }
},

{
	"keys": ["shift+escape"],
	"command": "choosy_selection_select",
	"args": { "preset": "choosy single selection", "forward": false }
},

{
	"keys": ["escape"], "command": "choosy_single_selection",
	"args": { "preset": "choosy single selection", "index": 0 },
	"context": [ { "key": "num_selections", "operator": "not_equal", "operand": 1 } ]
},
{
	"keys": ["shift+escape"], "command": "choosy_single_selection",
	"args": { "preset": "choosy single selection", "index": -1 },
	"context": [ { "key": "num_selections", "operator": "not_equal", "operand": 1 } ]
},

// Add back the old contexts, which were hidden by the above
{ "keys": ["escape"], "command": "clear_fields", "context":
	[
		{ "key": "has_next_field", "operator": "equal", "operand": true }
	]
},
{ "keys": ["escape"], "command": "clear_fields", "context":
	[
		{ "key": "has_prev_field", "operator": "equal", "operand": true }
	]
},
{ "keys": ["escape"], "command": "hide_panel", "args": {"cancel": true},
	"context":
	[
		{ "key": "panel_visible", "operator": "equal", "operand": true }
	]
},
{ "keys": ["escape"], "command": "hide_overlay", "context":
	[
		{ "key": "overlay_visible", "operator": "equal", "operand": true }
	]
},
{ "keys": ["escape"], "command": "hide_auto_complete", "context":
	[
		{ "key": "auto_complete_visible", "operator": "equal", "operand": true }
	]
},
```

You don't have to choose these keybindings. This uses the same backend as with saving and restoring selections.

Now when you press <kbd>ESC</kbd> an "afterimage" will be left. Continuing to press <kbd>ESC</kbd> will cycle forward. At all times <kbd>Shift-ESC</kbd> is the inverse of <kbd>ESC</kbd>.



### Useful bonuses using run_multiple_commands

## A duplicate that selects the just-duplicated line if done on a line

```jquery
{ "keys": [KEYBINDING], "command": "duplicate_line" },

{
	"keys": [KEYBINDING],
	"command": "run_multiple_commands",
	"context":
	[
		{ "key": "selection_empty", "operator": "equal", "operand": true, "match_all": true },
		{ "key": "num_selections", "operator": "equal", "operand": 1 }
	],
	"args": {
		"commands": [
			{ "command": "expand_selection", "args": {"to": "line"} },
			{ "command": "duplicate_line" },
		]
	},
},
```

Note that the two instances of `KEYBINDING` have to be the same, and should probably be that of your current duplication shortcut.




### Aligning cursors

```jquery
{ "keys": [KEYBINDING], "command": "align_cursor"},
```

Align the cursors to the first cursor, using the characters in the selection if possible, otherwise using the characters on either side of the cursor.

It will extend if any cursor is a selection, otherwise it will move.

If it cannot find a match, it will go to the line's end.
